		Dear UbSRD Users: Sorry for the delay in updating the database. I have been working on some behind the schenes changes to the framework of the database to make UbSRD easier to update and more versatile 
	<p>
</div>

<div class="underline">
	NEW FEATURES: 
</div>

<div class="col-md-16">
	– Many of the structures in UbSRD do not neatly fit into a single category, I have allowed structures to have multiple interaction types and UBLs. These changes are reflected in the search windows.
</div>
<p>
</p>
<div class="col-md-16">
	– The phospho-ubiquitin revolution is upon us. I have entered a new category in chain type that allows users to search for P65 ubiquitin/UBLs

    <h3>What is UbSRD?</h3>
    <p>
        UbSRD is a resource created to help classify and search
        ubiquitin-like fold containing structures. UbSRD also provides relational database interface for simplified analysis of
        the structural features of ubiqutin-like molecules and their interaction partners. Structures in UbSRD are grouped by ubiquitin-like fold type 
        and mode of protein-protein interaction, then we used the scientific benchmarking tools in 
        Rosetta3 to catalouge various features of this set <sup><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23422428">1</a></sup>.
        The purpose of this website is to 
        provide a frontend for simple browsing of the UbSRD database. To interact with the 
        database online, start with the <a href="/ubsrd/#browse/structure"> structure browsing page</a>.
        To do more complex structural analysis, download the database and check out our 
        <a href="/ubsrd/#examples">example analysis</a> page.
