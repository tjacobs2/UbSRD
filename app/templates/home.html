    <p>
        At it's core UbSRD aims to provide
        a method of probing the various structural features of Ubiquitin and ubiqutin like molecules. The
        purpose of this website is to provide a frontend for simple browsing of the UbSRD database. To start,
        take a look at our <a href="#overview">overview page</a>, which should give
        you a sense of what type of data is stored in the UbSRD database. For example analysis, look at our
