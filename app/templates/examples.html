Below are a collection of relatively simple examples meant to illustrate the types of analysis that
can be done with the UbSRD database. Each of these plots was generated by querying the UbSRD database
and tranforming that data into a plot using the excellent <a href="http://www.d3js.org">D3 javascript library</a>. For more detailed
overview of the data contained in UbSRD, please refer to the <a href="/api/erd">Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD).</a>

<div id="example1" class="row row-centered">
	<pre class="pre-scrollable" style="text-align: left;">
    SELECT 
        i.inter_type, count(*)
    FROM structures s
    JOIN interaction_type i ON
        s.struct_id = i.struct_id
    GROUP BY i.inter_type;
	</pre>
