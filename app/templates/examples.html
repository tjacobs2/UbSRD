<h3>How to use these examples</h3>
<p>
This page is meant to demonstrate how to query the UbSRD SQL database for users that download the .db3 file. 
UbSRD contains A LOT of data about the PDBs that it contains 
(see <a href="http://www.rosettacommons.org/docs/latest/scripting_documentation/RosettaScripts/FeaturesReporter/features_reporters/FeatureReporters"> Features Reporter</a>)
</p>

<p>
If you have downloaded the database, first make sure that you have Sqlite installed, then in a terminal type "sqlite3" followed by the database name. SQLite is a simple, yet powerful language,for working with databases and
the syntax is described here <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/lang.html"> SQLite. </a> To create UbSRD, we developed several UbSRD specific tables, yyping ".tables" will show you all the tables in the database and typing 
".schema" followed by a "your table name" will show you the column definitions for that table. We have also created  are also id tables for UBL type, protein-protein interactions (ppi_id), binding partner (target_id), and (chain_id) 
that contain all possible fields for each catagory. All the UBQ and SUMO chains are identified in seperate tables and the protein interactions for each chain are contained within this table. Users keep in mind that Rosetta renumbers
the protein chains and I have renumbered all the UBQ and SUMO chains so that they have identical numberings; therefore, to get the numbering found in the PDB use the ubq_numbering or sumo_numbering tables and the residue_pdb_identification 
table for non UBL chains. Now for some example queries! 
</p>

<p>
Below is an example of a query that counts how many structures there are for each interaction type. 
The plot uses D3 and show the up-to-date counts for each interaction type <a href="http://www.d3js.org">D3 javascript library</a>.
