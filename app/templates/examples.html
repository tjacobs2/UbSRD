Below are a collection of relatively simple examples meant to illustrate the types of analysis that
can be done with the UbSRD database. Each of these plots was generated by querying the UbSRD database
and tranforming that data into a plot using the excellent <a href="http://www.d3js.org">D3 javascript library</a>. For a more detailed
description of how to query the UbSRD database, see the <a href="#tutorials"> tutorials page </a>
